# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no metadata table.
# This schema will then be baselined with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake!

#
# The name of Flyway's metadata table (default **schema_version**).
# By default (single-schema mode) the metadata table is placed in the default schema for the connection provided by the datasource.

#
# Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. The location type is determined by its prefix.
# Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both sql and java-based migrations.
# Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem and may only contain sql migrations.
# IdmFlywayMigrationStrategy resolves used jdbc database dynamically - ${dbName} in location could be used.
